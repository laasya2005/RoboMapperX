## Autonomous Environment Navigator Robot
The full script for the simulation of the Autonomous Robot Navigator in the Pybullet Simulator has been given in this directory as Object_Detection_Final_beta.py. All the parts of the project - Object Detection using Deep Learning, Depth Map using stereo camera and OpenCV along with autonomous control of the robot, all have been compiled together to give a running script. 

### Environment
The environment is a 20 by 20 part of the plane. The arena has been prepared in such a manner that it would take at least 2-3 passes of the husky to be able to ‘see’ the other husky in its camera. Two each of ‘husky’, ‘teddy_large’, ‘humanoid’, ‘duck_vhacd’ and ‘cube’, and three each of ‘r2d2’ and ‘sphere2red’ were used, all of which are inbuilt objects available in the pybullet_data package. All the corresponding URDFs along with their .obj and .mtl files are given in this directory.

#### Make sure that you have installed the latest version of ImageAI and the relevant version of tensorflow, before running this script.
